Leveraging the power of SpaCy, a leading natural language processing (NLP) library, this project aims to uncover and organize information in the form of subject-predicate-object relationships within a given text corpus.\n\n**Objective:**\n\nThe primary goal of SPOextractor is to enhance information retrieval by identifying and extracting meaningful connections within the text. By focusing on subject-predicate-object structures, the project aims to distill factual content, making it easier to understand, analyze, and utilize the essential relationships embedded in the text.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n- **SpaCy Integration:** SPOextractor relies on the capabilities of SpaCy, a powerful and efficient NLP library, to perform accurate and context-aware text processing.\n\n- **Fact-like Structures:** The project specifically targets fact-like structures, emphasizing the extraction of subject-predicate-object relationships that represent concrete information within the text.\n\n- **Text Corpus Analysis:** SPOextractor is designed to handle text corpora, enabling users to process large volumes of textual data and extract valuable fact-based insights.\n\n**How It Works:**\n\n1. **Text Processing:** The project begins by processing the input text using SpaCy, which performs tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing.\n\n2. **SPO Extraction:** Through sophisticated linguistic analysis, SPOextractor identifies and extracts subject-predicate-object structures, revealing the factual relationships present in the text.\n\n3. **Structured Output:** The extracted information is then presented in a structured format, allowing users to easily comprehend and utilize the identified subject-predicate-object relationships.\n\n**Applications:**\n\n- **Information Retrieval:** SPOextractor enhances the retrieval of factual information from diverse textual sources, aiding in knowledge extraction.\n\n- **Data Analysis:** The structured output facilitates data analysis by providing a clear representation of relationships between entities in the text.\n\n- **Automated Processing:** The project can be integrated into automated systems, streamlining the extraction of factual content for various applications.\n\n**Work in progress*","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from re import sub\nimport collections\nimport spacy\n\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\nnlp.add_pipe(\"merge_noun_chunks\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-11-27T21:26:39.497921Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-11-27T21:26:39.498456Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-11-27T21:26:40.738703Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-11-27T21:26:39.498417Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-11-27T21:26:40.737156Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"execution_count":6,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"<function spacy.pipeline.functions.merge_noun_chunks(doc: spacy.tokens.doc.Doc) -> spacy.tokens.doc.Doc>"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def mergeTokensUponSideRelativity(tokenCompound: list, tokenComplement: list) -> list:\n    \"\"\"The function merges input tokens in respect to their position in a sentence\"\"\"\n    mergedTokenList = tokenCompound + tokenComplement\n    mergedTokenIndexDict = {}\n\n    for tok in mergedTokenList:\n        mergedTokenIndexDict[tok.i] = tok\n\n    orderdDict = collections.OrderedDict(sorted(mergedTokenIndexDict.items()))\n\n    return list(orderdDict.values())\n\ndef demlimiter(seq: list) -> dict:\n    \"\"\"The function creates dict object using delimiter as key and its set as value\"\"\"\n    result_dict = {}\n    l = []\n    for token in seq:\n        # the hypothesis is that object sequence ends with object itself\n        if token.dep_ in [\"pobj\", \"dobj\", \"obj\", \"conj\"]:\n            # compile obj and its complementation then add to dict, obj as key\n            l.append(token)\n            result_dict[token.text] = ' '.join([token.text for token in l])\n            # empty the list\n            l = []\n        else:\n            # fill the list with object complementation\n            l.append(token)\n    return result_dict\n\ndef getVerbConj(verb) -> tuple:\n    \"\"\"The function gets verbs' conjuctions\"\"\"\n    # Condition -
